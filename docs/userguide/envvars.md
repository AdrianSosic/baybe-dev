```{admonition} New Settings Control Mechanism
:class: attention

This page has been removed since BayBE now offers a streamlined mechanism for settings
control via its {class}`~baybe.settings.Settings` class.

For more information, have a look at the corresponding [user guide](/userguide/settings) 
and its section on [environment variables](/userguide/settings#environment-variables).
