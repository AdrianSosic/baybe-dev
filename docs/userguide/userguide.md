# User Guide

BayBE is organized around a central [`Campaign`](baybe.campaign.Campaign) object,
which suggests new measurements according to the bayesian optimization
procedure. The below diagram explains how the [`Campaign`](baybe.campaign.Campaign)
can be used to perform the **Bayesian Optimization Loop**, 
how the [`Campaign`](baybe.campaign.Campaign) can be **Configured** and 
how the results can be **Post-Analysed**.
